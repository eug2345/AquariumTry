Create a Controller class pls
Set up a MySQL database using the supplied SQL queries
Set up a test database
Completed the TODO methods in AquariumManager
Completed the testing in AquariumManagerTest (Still aiming for 80% coverage if possible!)
Stretch goals to consider:

Using a scanner to allow the user to enter their own data
Incorporating more tables and objects, maybe some lizards? Or fish supplies like tanks, and food?
Adding more methods to the manager classes
Overall this is quite a lot of work so don't expect to finish it all, but if you have any questions make sure to ask :)
